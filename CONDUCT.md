# Code of Conduct

Here we work together in a decent way.
We are goal-oriented. 
Who we we are, and what personal characteristics we have, is not important to this project.
What matters is the quality of work we can deliver together.
When conflicting opinions arise, we discuss them in plain, direct language, without getting personal.
