Everything
about
,
everything
around
,
everything
we
know
and
can
know
of
is
composed
ultimately
of
patterns
of
;
thatâ€™s
the
bottom
,
the
final
.
So
where
we
find
we
have
any
control
over
those
,
why
not
make
the
most
elegant
,
the
most
enjoyable
and
good
,
in
our
own
?
,
it
left
the
humans
in
the
Culture
free
to
take
care
of
the
things
that
really
mattered
in
,
such
as
,
,
,
studying
dead
,
barbarian
societies
and
impossible
,
and
climbing
high
mountains
without
the
aid
of
a
safety
.
